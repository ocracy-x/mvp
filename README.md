Sharing moments from my life through technologies that I am currently learning

# Notes

- User Authentication with Email Link sign in through FirebaseAuth

- Avoid making things from scratch unless absolutely necessary. Instead, use open source software and sightly modify to look unique.

  - Auth pages LoginPage and LinkSent page were custom made because I couldn't get EmailLinkController update state correctly.
